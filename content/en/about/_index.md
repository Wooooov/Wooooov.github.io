### Some meaningful events in my recent years
#### The 1st thing:
During my high school, I was always one of the worst performers in physical education class, especially in the 800-meter run test, which I never completed. During my freshman year of college, I wanted to do something to improve my physical condition, so I started to run regularly. My initial goal was to run two or five laps, but as I continued running, I found more joy in it. By the end of my freshman year, I was able to run twenty laps. During the relatively leisurely two years of college, I ran almost five kilometers every day, sometimes even in the morning and evening. I never imagined that in just two years, I went from not being able to complete an 800-meter run to being able to run over ten kilometers. This achievement always encourages me that there is no difficulty I cannot overcome. Currently, I still maintain this habit, although the frequency may be lower at times.

#### The 2nd thing:
During my preparation for the postgraduate entrance examination, in order to increase my chances of being admitted to my desired graduate school, I decided to take the Programming Ability Test (PAT). At that time, my programming skills were very weak, and the knowledge I learned in the basic programming course during my undergraduate studies was mostly theoretical. I only had a superficial understanding of some data structures and algorithms from books. After studying hard for a while, I took an offline exam. The sound of people around me typing on the keyboard proficiently in the exam room struck a blow to my self-esteem, and I performed poorly in the exam.

After some time, I registered for an online exam. At that time, I was also busy preparing for the entrance examination for the master's program. With the pressure and anxiety, the painful process and unsatisfactory results almost crushed me. I once felt that I was not born to be a programmer.

In my first year of graduate school, while organizing my browser bookmarks, I came across the website where I had practiced for the PAT exam a year ago. Suddenly, I had the idea of challenging myself again. I registered and started preparing. I started from scratch, exploring concepts I didn't understand before. This time, however, I found joy in learning. Every day of preparation was fulfilling and rewarding. Programming felt like having a teacher who corrected the logic of my assignments. It was truly wonderful to organize the structure and logic of a problem.

Now, my programming skills are still average, but I am happily walking on the path of learning. I am grateful that I did not let difficulties defeat me.
#### The 3rd thing:
Since I was young, I have been someone who is afraid to speak up in class and hesitant to express my own opinions. It seems that from the beginning, I left an impression of being introverted, and as a result, I naturally confined myself to my comfort zone and rarely stepped out of it. During my first year of graduate school, there were many courses, most of which required classroom presentations. In addition, our laboratory had weekly meetings where each team member took turns presenting. It is not an exaggeration to say that the number of presentations I gave in the first semester of my graduate studies exceeded the total number of times I had spoken in public throughout my life.
In the beginning stages, I would often be so nervous the night before a presentation that I couldn't sleep. However, I gradually discovered that preparing for presentations was a great way to organize my thoughts. Issues that I had overlooked or jumbled ideas became clearer as I prepared for the presentations. The thinking habits I developed not only helped me in my studies and research but also influenced how I approach life and handle situations. This year, I even proactively signed up for an academic presentation competition at my university and received a second prize. Whenever I think about the changes I have made during my first year of graduate school, I am filled with deep emotions.

#### The 4th thing:
I finally made my person website!

#### Life is going on...

### Some components of myself
- Since I was young, I have had a great interest in art-related things. I have learned to play the guitar and erhu, and I am also interested in design aspects such as web design, logo design, charts, and PowerPoint presentations. My biggest hobby is drawing. I haven't received professional training in painting, so I usually self-study through copying and tutorials. I have tried using pencils, watercolors, and panel painting techniques.
- I am a dog person and I am extremely grateful to meet my dogs, wishing they can always be by my side.
