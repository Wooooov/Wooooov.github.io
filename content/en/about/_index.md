## **Some meaningful events in my life**
#### The 1st thing
&emsp;&emsp;In my high school, I was always one of the worst performers in PE class, especially in the running test. During my freshman year of college, I wanted to do something to adjust my state, so I began to run regularly. My initial goal was to run just 4 or 5 laps, but as I continued running, I found more joy in it. By the end of my freshman year, I was able to run over 20 laps. 

&emsp;&emsp;During the relatively leisurely two years of college, I ran roughly 5 kms every day, sometimes even two times of 5-kms running which in the morning and evening. I have never imagined that I went from being unable to complete an 800-meter running test to being able to run over 10 kms in just two years. 

&emsp;&emsp;This achievement always encourages me that I was capable of more than I thought. I still keep this habit now although the frequency may be lower than before.

#### The 2nd thing
&emsp;&emsp;During the application period for my master degree, I decided to take the Programming Ability Test (PAT) in order to make preperation for my desired graduate school. At that time, my programming skills were weak and the knowledge I learned in the basic programming course during my undergraduate studies was mostly theoretical. I only had a superficial understanding of some data structures and algorithm theorys at that time. After studying hard for a period, I took my first offline exam. I still remember on that day, the sound of people around me typing on the keyboard  just presented their proficiency and professionalism while I performed poorly in the exam.

&emsp;&emsp;After some time of practice, I registered for this test again. Actually while preparing for this test, I was also extremely busy preparing for the entrance examination for the master's program. With the huge pressure and anxiety, the painful learning process and unsatisfactory results almost crushed me and I once felt that I was a complete loser in programming. I would say I was very afraid of and refused to program in that period.

&emsp;&emsp;The turning point came in my first year of graduate school. While organizing my browser bookmarks, I came across the website where I had practiced for the PAT exam a year ago. Suddenly, I had the idea of challenging myself again. I signed up for the latest exam and started preparing. I started from scratch, exploring concepts I didn't understand before. And this time, I found pleasure in programming. Every day of preparation made me a huge sence of fulfillment and satisfaction. The process of programming is like teaching by a teacher who corrected the logic errors of my assignments. It was a truly wonderful feeling for me to organize the structure and logic of a problem.

&emsp;&emsp;Now, although I don't regard myself an excellent programmar, I am happily walking on the path of learning. I am really grateful that I wasn't defeated by the previous difficulties.

#### The 3rd thing
&emsp;&emsp;Since I was young, I had been someone who was really afraid to speak up in class and hesitant to express my own opinions in public. It seemed that I left an impression of being introverted at the beginning, then as a result, I naturally confined myself to my comfort zone and rarely stepped out of it.

&emsp;&emsp;During my first year in my master's degree, there were too many courses in my schedule, most of which required classroom presentations. In addition, my laboratory had weekly meetings where each member should make presentation in turns. It is not an exaggeration to say that the number of presentations I gave in the first semester of my graduate studies exceeded the total number of times I had spoken in public throughout my previous life.

&emsp;&emsp;At the beginning, I was always so nervous that I couldn't sleep at night before my presentation. However, I gradually discovered that preparing for presentations was a great way to organize my thoughts. During the process of preparing a presentation, some jumbled ideas and the issues that I had overlooked generally became clearer. By the time I found it meaningful to me, I wasn't so afraid of it. Some thinking habits I developed from these presentation experience not only helped me in my studies but also influenced how I handle situations in my daily life. 

&emsp;&emsp;This year, I even proactively signed up for an academic presentation competition at my college and received a second prize. Whenever I think about these changes I have made in my recent years, I am filled with deep emotions.

#### Life is going on...

## **Some components of me**
- Since I was young, I have had a great interest in art. I have learned to play the guitar and erhu, and I am also interested in design, such as web design, logo design, charts design and so on. 
- My biggest hobby is drawing. Although I haven't received professional training in painting, I usually self-study through copying and tutorials. I have tried using pencils, watercolors, and panel painting techniques.

- I am a dog person and I am extremely grateful to meet my dogs, wishing they can always be by my side.
