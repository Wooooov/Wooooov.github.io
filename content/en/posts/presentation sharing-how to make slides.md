 This is the video record of a lecture by Professor Susan McConnell from the Department of Biology at Stanford University. The lecture's topic is: *Design effective secientific presentations: using PowerPoint and structuring your talk*.
 This lecture helped me a lot and I gained many useful suggestions from it.

## Some notes 
### what the audience want to gain from a talk:
-contain enough background 
-not hard to understand: the audience are able to see the data, understand it and interpret it

### PPT basics:
- what front to use: 
  - a Sans Serif font.
  - type size: better in 18-36 point, 14 point for the reference part.
- color: 
  - dark letters against a light background are best for small room.
  - a dark blue or black background works best for talks in a large room.
- layout: 
  - every slide has a heading (just a simple sentence).
  - limit text blocks to no more than 2 lines.
  - be generous with empty space.
  - include a simple image on every slide.
- a ideal PPT contains: 
  - a simple statemnet at the top
  - a simple visual 
  - what you as a speaker are saying
  - (make the same content be delivered through three channels at the same time)
- style:
  - each slide makes just one or two points
  - a simple rule: "If you're not going to take the time to explain it, get rid of it"
  - avoid fancy transitions between slides (if it will help you to deliver your content, it may make sence)
  - don't drown the audience with data
  - less is more, just get feedback from practice and colleagues to make sure you are not overwhelming people with too much contents
