During my freshman year of college, I wanted to do something I want to do something to adjust my state, so I began to run regularly. My initial goal was to run just 4 or 5 laps, but as I continued running, I found more joy in it. By the end of my freshman year, I was able to run over 20 laps.</p><p>During the relatively leisurely two years of college, I ran roughly 5 kms every day, sometimes even two times of 5-kms running in morning and evening. I never imagined that in just two years, I went from not being able to complete an 800-meter run to being able to run over 10 kms.</p><p>This achievement always encourages me that there is no difficulty I cannot overcome. Currently, I still maintain this habit, although the frequency may be lower at times.</p><h4 id=the-2nd-thing>The 2nd thing<a href=#the-2nd-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>During my preparation for the postgraduate entrance examination, in order to be admitted to my desired graduate school, I decided to take the Programming Ability Test (PAT). At that time, my programming skills were very weak, and the knowledge I learned in the basic programming course during my undergraduate studies was mostly theoretical. I only had a superficial understanding of some data structures and algorithm theory. After studying hard for a while, I took an offline exam. I still remember on that day, the sound of people around me typing on the keyboard proficiently in the exam room struck a blow to my self-esteem, and I performed poorly in the exam.</p><p>After some time, I registered for the test again. While preparing for this test, I was also busy preparing for the entrance examination for the master&rsquo;s program. With the huge pressure and anxiety, the painful process and unsatisfactory results almost crushed me. I once felt that I was a complete loser in programming.</p><p>In my first year of graduate school, while organizing my browser bookmarks, I came across the website where I had practiced for the PAT exam a year ago. Suddenly, I had the idea of challenging myself again. I registered and started preparing. I started from scratch, exploring concepts I didn&rsquo;t understand before. This time, I found pleasure in programming. Every day of preparation made me feel fulfilled and meaningful. The process of programming is like teaching by a teacher who corrected the logic of my assignments. It was a truly wonderful feeling for me to organize the structure and logic of a problem.</p><p>Now, my programming skills are still average, but I am happily walking on the path of learning. I am really grateful that I wasn&rsquo;t defeated by these difficulties.</p><h4 id=the-3rd-thing>The 3rd thing<a href=#the-3rd-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>Since I was young, I have been someone who is afraid to speak up in class and hesitant to express my own opinions in public. It seems that from the beginning, I left an impression of being introverted, then as a result, I naturally confined myself to my comfort zone and rarely stepped out of it.</p><p>During my first year in my master&rsquo;s degress, there were so many courses, most of which required classroom presentations. In addition, our laboratory had weekly meetings where each team member took turns presenting. It is not an exaggeration to say that the number of presentations I gave in the first semester of my graduate studies exceeded the total number of times I had spoken in public throughout my life.</p><p>At the beginning, I was always so nervous that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night before my presentation. However, I gradually discovered that preparing for presentations was a great way to organize my thoughts. During the process of preparing a presentation, issues that I had overlooked and some jumbled ideas generally became clearer. Some thinking habits I developed from these experience not only helped me in my studies but also influenced how I approach life and handle situations.</p><p>This year, I even proactively signed up for an academic presentation competition at my college and received a second prize. Whenever I think about the changes I have made during my first year of master&rsquo;s degress, I am filled with deep emotions.</p><h4 id=the-4th-thing>The 4th thing<a href=#the-4th-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>I finally made my person website!</p><h4 id=life-is-going-on>Life is going on&mldr;<a href=#life-is-going-on class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><hr><h2 id=some-components-of-me>Some components of me<a href=#some-components-of-me class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><ul><li>Since I was young, I have had a great interest in art.

I have tried using pencils, watercolors, and panel painting techniques.</li></ul><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=/images/sandy.jpg itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=/images/sandy.jpg width=300></a><figcaption><h4>This painting was created by myself using Procreate on iPad</h4></figcaption></figure><ul><li>I am a dog person and I am extremely grateful to meet my dogs, wishing they can always be by my side.</li></ul><figure itemprop=associatedMedia itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><a href=/images/mydog.jpg itemprop=contentUrl><img itemprop=thumbnail src=/images/mydog.jpg width=300></a><figcaption><h4>They are Coco, Tiaotiao, and Guagua (from left to right).</h4></figcaption></figure><p style=color:#777>2023-08-12</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:rgba(80,79,78,.601)></i></a><div>☝ Return to the top</div></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script>
