However, during my freshman year of college, I decided to make a change and started running regularly. Initially, my goal was modest—just 4 or 5 laps—but as I kept at it, I began to enjoy running more and more. By the end of my freshman year, I was able to run over 20 laps.</p><p>  During the relatively relaxed two years of college, I made it a habit to run approximately 5 kilometers every day, sometimes even twice a day, with one run in the morning and another in the evening. I never imagined that I could go from struggling to complete an 800-meter run to comfortably running over 10 kilometers in just two years.</p><p>  This achievement has always reminded me that I’m capable of more than I initially believe. I still maintain this habit, even if the frequency is lower than before.</p><h4 id=the-2nd-thing>The 2nd thing<a href=#the-2nd-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>  During the application period for my master’s degree, I decided to take the Programming Ability Test (PAT) to better prepare for my desired graduate school. At that time, my programming skills were weak, and most of what I had learned in my undergraduate programming courses was largely theoretical. My understanding of data structures and algorithms was superficial at best. After studying intensely for a while, I took my first offline exam. I still vividly remember the sound of people around me typing away confidently, showcasing their proficiency and professionalism, while I struggled through the exam.</p><p>  After some practice, I registered for the test again. However, this time I was also extremely busy preparing for the entrance exam for my master’s program. The immense pressure and anxiety, coupled with the grueling learning process and disappointing results, nearly broke me. I often felt like a complete failure in programming, and for a period, I was genuinely afraid of and resistant to coding.</p><p>  The turning point came in my first year of graduate school. While organizing my browser bookmarks, I stumbled upon the website where I had practiced for the PAT exam a year earlier. On a whim, I decided to challenge myself once more. I signed up for the latest exam and began preparing again. This time, I approached the material from the ground up, delving into concepts I hadn’t fully understood before. To my surprise, I found joy in programming. Each day of preparation brought a deep sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. The process felt like being taught by a mentor, as I worked through and corrected logical errors in my code. It was truly rewarding to structure and solve problems with clarity and precision.</p><p>  Now, although I don’t consider myself an excellent programmer, I am contentedly progressing on this learning journey. I’m truly grateful that I wasn’t defeated by the earlier challenges.</p><h4 id=the-3rd-thing>The 3rd thing<a href=#the-3rd-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>  Since I was young, I had always been the person who was afraid to speak up in class and hesitant to express my opinions in public. This tendency made me seem introverted, and as a result, I naturally confined myself to my comfort zone, rarely stepping out of it.</p><p>  During my first year of my master’s degree, my schedule was packed with courses, many of which required classroom presentations. Additionally, my lab held weekly meetings where each member had to present in turn. It’s no exaggeration to say that the number of presentations I gave in my first semester of graduate school exceeded the total number of times I had spoken in public throughout my entire life before that.</p><p>  At first, I was so nervous before each presentation that I couldn’t sleep the night before. However, I gradually discovered that preparing for presentations was an excellent way to organize my thoughts. The process of creating a presentation helped me clarify jumbled ideas and address issues I had previously overlooked. Once I realized how meaningful this was, my fear began to subside. The thinking habits I developed through these presentation experiences not only aided me in my studies but also influenced how I approach situations in my daily life.</p><p>  This year, I even took the initiative to sign up for an academic presentation competition at my college and was awarded second prize. Whenever I reflect on the changes I’ve made in recent years, I am filled with deep emotions.</p><h4 id=the-4th-thing>The 4th thing<a href=#the-4th-thing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><p>  Wow, it&rsquo;s November 3, 2023, and I&rsquo;ve just finished my oral English homework. I’m suddenly feeling inspired, so I think it’s time to record my fourth reflection. A moment ago, I realized that my oral English has improved significantly while doing my homework. Although this might seem like a small achievement, just a few months ago, it was a source of considerable stress, both mentally and physically.</p><p>  I realized just how poor my oral English was when I began preparing for the IELTS exam. In the past, I had always learned English easily, but during that time, one of the main challenges was that I didn’t have enough time to study systematically. Looking back, I now see that the bigger issue was my reluctance to admit that certain aspects of my English skills needed improvement. A stubborn ego, indeed!</p><p>  I still remember spending half of that month practicing my oral English, but I was incredibly inefficient. I was too eager to improve, which only fueled my frustration. I kept asking myself, &ldquo;Why do you speak English like a child?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why does your accent sound so off?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you talk more about this topic?&rdquo; I was constantly blaming myself, convinced I was a failure. It might seem odd that something so small affected me so much, but I think I was experiencing a bit of neurasthenia during that period. With too many assignments to complete and very little sleep, it was a dark time for me. I even cried several times out of frustration because I felt like I wasn’t improving. Then, something good happened—I received an ideal score on the test, and my self-blame finally came to an end. However, I knew my oral English still needed work, so I enrolled in a small online course taught by a content creator I followed on Bilibili. The course began on September 21, 2023, and I consider this the true start of my journey to improving my oral English.</p><p>  I have just one two-hour class per week for eight weeks. Each week, I need to submit two voice recordings as homework—sometimes with a specific topic, but often just sharing whatever I want with my teacher. I’m not focusing on how well my teacher instructs; rather, what stands out is how different this slow, relaxed approach to learning is compared to my previous intense study routines. This time, I didn’t push myself to the limit; instead, I attended each class and completed my homework without setting overly ambitious goals, just taking things step by step. Initially, I still struggled with my performance, but now, in the sixth week, I’ve noticed a significant improvement. While I may not speak fluent or native-like English yet, I can express my thoughts and feelings with much more ease.</p><p>  All I hope to tell myself in the the furture are:</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t be anxiey and stop blaming yourself.</li><li>Learing everything just like you are a naive kid, do not overestimate or underestimate your ability.</li><li>Practice makes perfect.</li><li>Slow is fast.</li></ul><p>  I understand that these are common experiences, but learning from others is one thing—making them your own is another. Now, these are my personal experiences and achievements. I hope to carry these lessons and principles with me into the future.</p><h4 id=life-is-going-on>Life is going on&mldr;<a href=#life-is-going-on class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h4><hr><h2 id=some-components-of-me><strong>Some components of me</strong><a href=#some-components-of-me class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> #</a></h2><ul><li>Since I was young, I have had a deep interest in art.
